## Overview
This project analyzed aviation data collected over a span of a couple of years. The analysis shows the effect different factors have on the accident rates and gives recommendations on investing in the industry.
## Business problem
We aim to figure out:
Aircraft manufacturers to invest in.
Engine models and makes with proven safety records
Less accident-prone areas
Types of flights e.g. instructional, public flights to invest in
## Data
The dataset contains data from the National Transport Safety Board that is comprised of aviation
accident data from 1962 to 2023 in the United States and International Waters.
The data contains records such as engine types, engine models, makes, weather conditions
leading into the accidents listed.
## Methods
This project uses visualization to gain insight into the effect these different
factors have on the accident rates. 
## Results
Reciprocating engines have high accident rates
U.S.A. is a high-risk aviation area as per the high number of accidents recorded there.
CESSNA and piper engines have very high failure rates.
